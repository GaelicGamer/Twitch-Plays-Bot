Created Support for fractional movements while smoothing is on (i.e. "lsup 0.5" or "lsd 1.2" )
Created Shorthand of commands !hold = !h, !release = !r, !pausingon = !pon, !pausingoff = !poff, !smoothon = !son, !smoothoff = !soff (long commands still work as they did before)
Added Autosmoothing that can be personalized from the "auto_smooth_settings.txt" file
reworked smoothing so that while pausing is on the executing the same command twice will execute both commands as one continuous command
added !autosmoothon/!ason and !autosmoothoff/!asoff to control auto smoothing and added !wait and !w to allow the user to wait without pressing any buttons
!hold and !release are no longer case sensitive
allows the !hold and !release modifiers to be put before the command (still allows for modifiers to be put after the command as well)
